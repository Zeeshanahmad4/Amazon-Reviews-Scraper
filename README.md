##  Why This Matters 
- Amazon reviews influence **buyer trust** and **conversion rates**.  
- Competitors and researchers need large volumes of reviews for **trend analysis** and **benchmarking**.  
- Manual review gathering is inefficient.  
- **This scraper solves the bottleneck** by offering structured, automated, and scalable review collection.

**High-Level Flow**:  
1. Chrome automation opens product review pages.  
2. Collector extracts review data into structured schema.  
3. Validator ensures required fields (rating, title, date, etc.).  
4. Writers export to CSV/JSON.  
5. Optional enrichment adds sentiment/keywords.

csv_path = Path("sample.csv")
with csv_path.open("w", newline="", encoding="utf-8") as f:
    writer = csv.DictWriter(f, fieldnames=rows[0].keys())
    writer.writeheader()
    writer.writerows(rows)
